# CODE QUIZ CHALLENGE

## Introduction

This task is about generating an interactive webpage which has 4 questions related to javascript fundamentals. Integrated into the webpage is a timer which is also a score tally. The idea is that if an answer to the question is incorrect 10 seconds will be deducted of the time. The final time represents the score.

## Methods Emplyed

In this challenge I have tried to employ the following methods to build a questionnaire on javascript fundamentals:
* functions

* creating an array of objects which has key, value pairs reflecting each question and answers

* creating new elements within the given index.HTML to enrich the basic HTML template

* creating and using data-* to indicate the correct and incorrect answers to each question

* iterating through the object orientated array and attaching the iterations to HTML elements

* working with local storage to publish in text format the end score and initials of game player. Requires the use of localStorage.setItem, localStorage.getItem and localStorage.clear

* trying to refactor repetitive parts of code.

* working with timeInterval to set the time and manipulate it to indicate penalty for wrong answers

# Mock-Up

This will be provided

# Problems encountered

1. unable to iterate through the 4 questions despite multiple attempts so would value help in this aspect

2. working out where to place localStorage syntax to obtain end scores
